# snake
使用面向对象思想，使用javascript构建的贪吃蛇游戏。 实现了蛇的移动，蛇吃到食物就增长和加分，吃到2个食物后就加速，蛇吃到自己和撞到墙壁会死亡，死亡后点击游戏结束的框重新开始游戏。

This is a simple clone of the snake game. and it is the first time for me to attempt to use Canvas.

The game is a Object Oriented Programming. It has been implement 5 functions

1. moving of snake
2. eat food and then add score
3. if the snake eat  more 2 food , it will speed up
4. if the snake eat itself or touch grid, it will die
5. cilck "game over" button, the game will restart
